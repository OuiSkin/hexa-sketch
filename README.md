#Designing OuiSkin_Product

##Software


###3D Models

To visualize and edit the 3D models, you need to have [Catia](http://www.3ds.com/products/catia/) installed on your computer.


###Fritzing

To visualize the Arduino design of OuiSkin_Product, you need to download & install [Fritzing](http://www.fritzing.org) for your platform. Fritzing is a great tool for designing and for sharing your sketches, connections and so on.


##Bill of Material


Because we think that being able to build your own OuiSkin_Product is the best way to improve it, we've made available all the components we use for our OuiSkin_Product.
All of them can be purchased at [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/), [DFRobot](http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php) or [RobotShop](http://www.robotshop.com/).
Feel free to notify us if you find cheaper retailers in your country, we'll add them to the list! :)
